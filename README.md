# Oil + Lualine Issue

Using Oil with Lualine is not working. 

I don't know why, but this is reproducible example that shows the issue.

The bad lualine install also messes with my buffer editing, telescope, and even just quitting nvim?!?

![./demonstration.mp4](./demonstration.mp4)

It seems like this an issue with nightly neovim... treesitter is also not working, same with basic cmp and more plugins... :(
